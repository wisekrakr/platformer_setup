# platformer_setup
A setup for a html/javascript platformer game. 

This setup contains an engine, display, controller and game class to start off with a simple html game. <br>
Some extra examples are added for reference. This setup was used for my js13kGames entry https://github.com/wisekrakr/DSMS_redux <br>
That game can be seen here https://wisekrakr.github.io/DSMS_redux/index.html <br>

This can be used as is, but it is recommended that you use it as a template to create something for your own. This code was simplified
so it can be used in many situations. <br>
For my js13kGames entry I changed a lot for my game to work smoother. So I recommend you do the same.
